# AI-Enhanced Development Workflow for Replit Projects

This guide outlines a structured, efficient workflow for developing coding projects on Replit, leveraging AI capabilities to accelerate development while maintaining high-quality standards.

## 1. Project Definition & Planning

### 1.1 Define Your Project Scope
- **Project Type**: Clearly specify what you're building (web app, CLI tool, game, data analysis, etc.)
- **Core Functionality**: List 3-5 essential features that define your minimum viable product
- **Target Audience**: Identify who will use your project and what problems it solves
- **Success Metrics**: Define how you'll measure if your project meets its goals

### 1.2 Requirements Gathering
- Create user stories in the format: "As a [user type], I want [action] so that [benefit]"
- Prioritize features using MoSCoW method (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have)
- Identify potential technical challenges and dependencies
- Create a project roadmap with milestones

## 2. Technology Stack Selection

### 2.1 Choose Your Primary Language
Based on your project type, select the most appropriate language:
- **Web Applications**: JavaScript/TypeScript (React, Vue, Angular), Python (Flask, Django)
- **Data Science**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow)
- **Game Development**: Python (Pygame), JavaScript (Phaser)
- **Automation**: Python, JavaScript, Bash
- **Mobile**: JavaScript (React Native), Dart (Flutter)

### 2.2 Framework Selection
Select frameworks and libraries that best align with your project requirements:
- **Frontend**: React, Vue, Angular, Svelte
- **Backend**: Express.js, Flask, Django, FastAPI
- **Database**: SQLite, MongoDB, PostgreSQL
- **State Management**: Redux, Context API, Vuex
- **Testing**: Jest, Pytest, Mocha

### 2.3 Development Tools
Identify tools that will enhance your development workflow:
- **Version Control**: Git (built into Replit)
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier, Black, Flake8
- **Task Runners**: npm scripts, Python scripts
- **Documentation**: JSDoc, Sphinx, Swagger

## 3. Project Initialization & Setup

### 3.1 Create Replit Project
- Choose the appropriate template for your language/framework
- Configure .replit file for custom run commands if needed
- Set up environment variables in Replit Secrets for sensitive information

### 3.2 Establish Project Structure
Create a clean, organized structure:
